Vodon Pro is a **synchronised**, desktop video player for esport "VOD" reviews. It is designed for live reviews, either over screenshare or in person.

Add viewpoints from each player in a match, tell Vodon how to synchronise the videos then watch your match playback with the ability to instantly jump to any of the viewpoints to review your game.

## Screenshots

### Synchronising videos

![Setup videos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rodeoclash/vodon-pro/main/screenshots/setup.png)

_Everything starts in Vodon by telling it how to synchronise your videos. Align each video to the same point in time in the match._

### Reviewing videos

![Reviewing videos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rodeoclash/vodon-pro/main/screenshots/review.png)

_With the videos aligned, the global time control can be used to navigate all videos. Click the videos in the sidebar to instantly jump to that players point of view._

### Drawing on frames

_Vodon Pro even has drawing tools. Use these to annotate the frame that you're talking about it in the review._

### Bookmarks

## Frequently asked questions

### Why do I get warned about the download?

When you download, you may see one or more warnings about the download being "unsafe". This is due to code signing and while I can pay (about $100AUD) to sign my downloads, I haven't got this in place just yet.

### Why use this over the inbuilt replay tools?

If you're performing VOD reviews on games with inbuilt replay tools then Vodon Pro will be a poor substitute for those tools... use them instead! That said, not all games support replay files or allow you to easily find and share them.

### Why is this an app? I want to use it online!

This comes down to a few reasons, they are:

1. Video hosting costs a lot of money.
2. When you store videos that users have uploaded, you compress them to save on space. This means that the videos lose visual quality.
3. Streaming 5 1080p 60fps videos at once will crush almost anyones Internet connection (even if you compress the videos like in 2!)
4. Seeks to new locations should be _instant_. I hate clicking to go somewhere in a video and seeing a buffering icon.
